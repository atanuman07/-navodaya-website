Navodaya Coaching Center â€” Static Website (English + Bangla)
===========================================================

Files included:
- index.html
- styles.css
- assets/logo.png

How to host for FREE on GitHub Pages:
1. Create a GitHub account (if you don't have one).
2. Create a new repository (e.g., `navodaya-website`).
3. Upload the files and `assets` folder to the repository root.
4. In repository Settings -> Pages -> Source, select branch `main` (or `master`) and folder `/ (root)`, then Save.
5. After a minute, your site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`
   - If you want it at the root (https://<your-username>.github.io) name the repo `<your-username>.github.io`.

Notes about YouTube embed (latest uploads):
- The HTML tries to embed channel uploads using:
  `https://www.youtube.com/embed?listType=user_uploads&list=crackjnvst`
- If that doesn't show the latest videos for your channel, you can:
  1. Open a specific video on YouTube.
  2. Copy its video ID from the URL (after "v=").
  3. Replace the iframe src with `https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID`
  Example:
  `<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/abc123xyz" ...></iframe>`

Want me to:
- Upload this to a GitHub repo for you (I can provide the exact files and a step-by-step screenshot guide), or
- Make any text/content changes (city name, batch details, prices)?
